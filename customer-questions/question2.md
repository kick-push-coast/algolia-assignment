### Question

Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, Matt

### Response

Hi Matt,

Thank you for the honest feedback. I'm (sadly) very familiar with being on the receiving end of a product change that makes my workflow more difficult... so I don't take this topic lightly. Our product team doesn't take it lightly either. They are always looking for insight into how their changes affect real day-to-day users, so I'm happy to pass your feedback along to them.

In the meantime, maybe there is a way to make the change a little less painful in the short term. You're absolutely right that it now takes more clicks to clear or delete an index from the dashboard. A couple of things that we've seen work well for others that might be helpful in this regard:

- If it makes sense to, creating a dedicated test or dev index for you to make changes on could possibly reduce the amount of clearing and re-indexing you need to do
- Algolia also offers APIs and CLI tools that can help you manage indexes programatically so you don't have to do everything manually through the dashboard

If you're interested in setting up a test index workflow or curious about how our APIs can be used to automate index management, let me know and I can get into more detail about these topics! Again, we appreciate your feedback and I will be submitting that for the product team to take a look at shortly.

Cheers,  
Mike
